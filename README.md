# mesh_branchfilter
a small gadget to filter ffmap-backends output for subcommunities

## Getting started
copy the example config to "config.py"
```
cp config.py.example config.py
```

modify the config.py, if you do not prefer to see hanovers json files and it's test branch "ffi"

The following two lines are pretty self explaining, just enter the filepaths of your metacommunity.
(e.g. large hanover for small ippensen)
```
nodes_json_url = 'http://hannover.freifunk.net/meshviewer/nodes.json'
graph_json_url = 'http://hannover.freifunk.net/meshviewer/graph.json'
```

The last line contains a list of branches your meshviewer shall show.
(e.g. 'stable', 'area51' or 'small subcommunity behind the moon')
```
site_codes = ['ffi']
```

## Have a look at hanover (example)
[Hanovers original meshviewer](http://hannover.freifunk.net/meshviewer) with json files generated by [ffmap-backend](https://github.com/ffnord/ffmap-backend)

[Ippensens meshviewer](http://ippensen-freifunk.net/meshviewer) relying on files generated by this tool

## Hint
Do not enter meshviewers feeded by this tool to api.freifunk.net, as it will result in duplicate nodes.
